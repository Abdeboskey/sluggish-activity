# Sluggish Activity

Sluggish Activity is an application that helps encourage users who are feeling sluggish, stuck, down, or who just don't know what to do with their free time.
Users can interact with a friendly snail, who can collect some information about what kind of activity they're interested in and suggest things to do. If a user likes a suggestion, the snail can record that activity in their journal, where activities are organized by date. 

This was the final solo front-end project for module 3 of Turing School of Software and Design's 2008 inning. This project was a summation of all that had been taught this module and technologies used in this project include:

* React JS
* React Router
* React Hooks
* React Testing Library
* Jest Testing Library
* Scss Modules
* Luxon
* LocalStorage

## Setup/Installation
- Clone the repo using `git clone git@github.com:Abdeboskey/sluggish-activity.git`.
- Run `npm install` in the root of the newly created directory to install the necessary dependencies.
- Running `npm start` in your terminal should launch the application in your browser. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application in action.
- Run `npm test` to run the test suite for this application. 

## Wins/Challenges
#### Wins
* Accomplished extensive test coverage including unit tests, implementation and integration level testing. 
* Greatly reduced the use of repetition in the styling by using scss variables and mixins.
* Learned a small bit of css animation using `@keyframes` to animate the friendly snail.

#### Challenges
* Kept dreaming too big and getting overwhelmed by the scope of what I was planning
* Developing a fully routed and tested react application of my own design in 5 days. 
* Ran out of time for additional features that I had wanted to include.

## Future Iterations
#### In the future, users would be able to:
* Choose to go stargazing with the friendly snail (using NASA's photo of the day API), who knows a surprising amount about the cosmos.
* Have the friendly snail greet the user with an emotional check in and ask if you would like to write about your emotional state in your journal, which would be saved and be accesible later like the activities.
* Review activities that you have tried in your activity journal.
